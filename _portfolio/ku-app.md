KAPP is a Navigation and Information based Android App specially designed
    for Kathmandu University. KAPP uses Google Maps API to fetch the map of Kathmandu
    University from Google. This app uses GPS to pinpoint and display user’s location.  When
    a user approaches or passes by building inside the University, the App automatically
    pops up an information window displaying the information about the buildings which
    is at the proximity of the user. For the indoor (inside a building) navigation,
    KAPP also include the floor plan of the buildings(currently limited) where one
    can see the offices or labs of every floor which provides a helpful navigation
    inside of a building.
